## <a name='lifelog'>Processing Lifelog Data</a>

This is a cross-platform script used for processing lifelog data that has been collected for a machine learning research project at SNUH. 
The research defines lifelog data as a retroactive smartphone data that are extracted from 
[Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com), 
[Samsung Privacy](https://privacy.samsung.com/), 
[Call Blocker & Call Logs Backup](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.idea.backup.calllogs),
and possibly more. 
This scripts helps to automate the processing and cleaning of data that are collected from the aforementioned 
services so that they may be suitable for data analysis and modeling.
